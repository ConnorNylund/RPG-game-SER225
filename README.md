# SER225 Sector Survival

## What is this?
Our Game named Sector Survival was created for Quinnipiac's 2024 SER225 Agile Development class where a select students worked together to create/edit a RPG based game

Our game "Sector Survival" was designed to be similar to the very popular game "Black-Ops Zombies". Within our game you can find a wave based pvp systems, where you can accumulate currency, fight bosses, and find easter eggs.

You will find as you progress through waves more and more enemies will randomly spawn throughout unlocked zones, continuing to get more difficult.
